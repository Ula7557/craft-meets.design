                  "Alisher Narzullaev (born 1953) is a leading representative of the famous Gijduvan school of ceramics, named after the town of Gijduvan located 46 km north of Bukhara. A member of the sixth generation of a family dynasty of ceramists, he opened the Gijduvan Pottery Center in his hometown, where he teaches those who want to master the craft.",
                text: "<p>Abdullo Narzullaev (born in 1963) comes from a world famous dynasty of master ceramists from Gijduvan. He has managed not only to preserve ancient traditions and restore some forgotten secrets of craftsmanship, but also to expand the artistic facets of the Gijduvan school of ceramics. Abdullo Narzullaev has visited more than 100 countries, where he participated in international exhibitions and conferences. He also founded a ceramics museum in Gijduvan, where items from all regions of Uzbekistan and Central Asia are displayed.</p><p>Attention to detail. In some ceramics centres narrow specialisations are adopted, where one family is engaged only in the clay manufacture, for example, while another is tasked with preparing the dyes.  However, in Gijduvan a master must be able to perform the whole process themselves from start to finish. This results in a very long and difficult process, especially when every step is performed the old-fashioned way and compromises are not tolerated.  Therefore, in addition to knowledge and experience,  great patience is required in carrying out each of the 24 stages of ceramic production.</p><p>My father, the great master Ibodullo Narzullaev, used to say that no detail can be overlooked when we are working with ceramics. Even one oversight can seriously affect the quality of the product, but this can only be discovered after the final firing. I often tell a parable about an apprentice who for 20 years could not become a master simply because he did not blow off the dust before putting the product in the kiln and his work came out black.</p><p>Our work begins with the selection of clay, which we source here in Gijduvan.  We first remove the top seventy-centimetre layer and use only the next layer below. The clay must be clean, containing very little or no impurities such as sand.  We begin by experimenting on the selected clay, trying it first on small forms, and if it fits, only then will we work with it further. We add reed fluff to the clay, which reinforces it, making it stronger before finally we add gilmoya (bentonite), which is yellow sea clay from the Kiziltepa deposit ten kilometers from Gijduvan. The proportions of these ingredients are different depending on what kind of product is being made.</p><p>Before serving on the potter's wheel, the clay is processed several times; first by feet, then by hand. Next the clay is fed to the potter's wheel and moulding begins, after which it is necessary to dry the primary product a little and give it better shape. The following day, the excess layer is cut from the bottom. The item should now be dried at least a further two days before processing small flaws, grinding, and drying the product again.  At this stage it is again covered with a mix of liquid clay and natural dyes which we call engobe (slipware) to create a white, red or yellow background for the piece.  Again the item goes for further drying in the shade. Only after this can the painting begin.</p><p>Restoring the past ... It is important for me to feel in my works the correlation of three things: ornament, colour and form. Gijduvan ceramic painting is represented only by floral and geometric ornament, since historically our religion has not approved of the image of living beings. As for the palette of colours, my works are more varied: blue - white - green, yellow – brown and other combinations. At the same time as keeping the tradition of floral-geometric ornament, I also try to incorporate elements or at least a hint of people's lives. For example, pomegranates and almonds are presented on jugs or dishes. When decorating a composition, I like to incorporate special techniques such as dots or spots painting and we also include many meaningful symbols in the form of fruits, flowers and feathers. As with other masters, I like to combine brush painting alongside engraving and carving.</p><p>After applying the ornament, each piece goes through two firings in the kiln, between which it is covered with glaze. After a ten year quest of searching and testing, we managed to restore the ancient technology of making Ishkor glaze using certain plant species, specifically the shrubs Qirqbugin (Equisétum arvénse), Tuyatovon (Zygophyllum oxianum), Balik Kuzi (“Fish eye”) and others growing in the vicinity of Bukhara and the Khorezm region. We harvest them in October, burning and mixing the ash with a small amount of quartz sand which is baked at a temperature of 1400 degrees Celcius to get the crystal from which the glaze is made. It is thanks to such glaze that ancient ceramics did not lose their properties for many centuries.</p><p>Reflections from the master ... I am a sixth generation ceramist and since childhood have never considered another profession. It is customary here that children continue the work of their parents and grandparents. From the age of 6, my father took me with him to the workshop, and at the age of 14 I began to create my own items. </p><p>I am a teacher by profession, a graduate of the Pedagogical Institute from the Faculty of Engineering and Education. As a new graduate I taught at school and in my free time I made ceramics. After Uzbekistan achieved Independence, artists received an excellent opportunity to follow our beloved craft, and since 1992 I have completely devoted myself to ceramic art. Initially there were many who doubted and attempted to dissuade me, but my family supported me in my decision.  After a few years my work began to give good results. Of course, there have always been and will always remain difficulties, but it seems to me that there are no downsides to doing your favourite job, as with remaining devoted to a person who you truly love.</p><p>Almost 30 years after my decision to dedicate my life to ceramic art, in addition to crafting ceramic, I now actively participate at international exhibitions and exchange programs among craftsmen from different countries; I have already visited 108 countries, some more than once.</p><p>Yet I am especially proud of the ceramics museum we founded in 2000 in Gijduvan, where items from all regions of Uzbekistan and Central Asia are on display. It was also a kind of challenge, and without the support of collectors and craftsmen from all over our country, we certainly would not have been able to gather such a large exposition as we do now.</p><p>I have two daughters and a son, who also continue our work. My son works with me and my daughters are engaged in ceramics and Suzani embroidery. All have received university education and are following in our footsteps, continuing the work of our ancestors. </p><p>It is a fact that not everyone can stand such work. Many come to study with the intention to become masters, but are gone after a week. However, many persevere and I am happy to say that a number of wonderful artists have emerged from my workshop, some of whom have gained international fame. As our patron saint Hazrati Amir Kulol once said, “the master sees his reflection not in the mirror, but in his disciples”.</p>",

Unlike other prominent masters from this ancient pottery centre in the Fergana Valley, he didn’t come from a family of hereditary craftsmen. Yet after apprenticeships under several old masters, Alisher Nazirov achieved early recognition and was appointed Chief Artist at the local ceramic factory in 1989. He further developed his skills and unique style during lengthy internships in Japan and collaborations with the great ceramic schools there.  His works are now found in permanent collections of major museums and galleries in Uzbekistan, Russia and Japan among others. His creations represent the finest examples of the Rishtan ceramic school and never repeat each other, thanks to which some enthusiasts have nicknamed him the “Stradivarius of Rishtan”. Alisher Nazirov has won numerous awards, and, since 1997 has chaired the local association of craftsmen, however he considers his most important achievement the Rishtan Ceramic School which opened in 2005. His younger brother, son and nephews have followed in his footsteps, establishing a new ceramics dynasty in Uzbekistan.       \r\n \r\nCommunicating with the clay …  I belong to the traditional Rishtan school of ceramics, which means to be devoted to the rules and principles that our ancestors have practiced for thousands of years. The glory of our town’s ceramics comes from our unique red clay and its unique mineral composition. Such clay cannot be found elsewhere and, as a result, the quality of our pottery differs significantly from that of other regions. Authentic Rishtan ceramics should also have Ishqor glazing which is prepared by burning and crystalizing the ash of a local shrubby plant and adding some other natural ingredients. Each master has own approach and secret methods, but one must use only natural, locally sourced materials to be truly called a follower of the traditional Rishtan school. A failure to follow these methods may compromise the quality of our products. For example, some substances used in the process can be harmful to human health and ought only be applied to exterior ceramic décor. By adhering closely to our traditions, high quality is achieved.  During the Timurid Empire in the 14th and 15th Centuries, glazed tiles were applied to many buildings and for hundreds of years withstood both heat and cold.\r\nEvery master is free to express their artistic vision and style when it comes to painting patterns or choosing the shapes for various items. People recognize my creative style and can differentiate my products mainly due to the colours and patterns I employ, as well as some other “secret” features that one can observe when looking at or holding the physical item. Every craftsman should have his own style and hidden features, that is the mark of a real master. \r\nMy teachers insisted that we should literally greet the clay as we begin, and communicate with the products we are making during the entire working process.  We should  love our craft and impart a bit of our soul to our creations. In doing so, we need to love the clay itself and take close care of its transformation into a thing of beauty, finally passing it on to the customer with the same love. \r\nInspired by seasonal change … In each of my products I try to express my inner experiences. My work is often influenced by the change of seasons, the differences observed in natural landscapes, in plants and flowers; I receive inspiration from these divine cycles in our earth and sky.   Just as nature is in constant change, I can’t create two absolutely identical products. I try to put my soul into each item by creating a new pattern or composition through fantasising and turning my thoughts and feelings into paintings on clay. The images on my dishes reflect the slow and meditative process of my work itself. It is as if I wish to ask time to stop, to postpone the hustle and bustle of life and provide an opportunity to pause and think about the higher order of things; the grace of the fluffy thistle, the fertility of the pomegranate, the mysteriousness of the birds of paradise, the refinement of the silhouette of the kumgan (a jug with a narrow neck) or the depth of a shokh-kosa (rare deep soup dish). \r\nThe town where I live definitely affects my creativity.  This refers not only to the local clay, nature and landscape, but also to the entire atmosphere of this potters’ town and the satisfaction we experience as true artisans working among colleagues.  One particular pattern we use, called ‘Chorgul’ (four flowers), represents the theory that all four corners of the world coexist and are interconnected, while one’s own place is where one belongs. We potters can create art that reflects the beauty of the entire world without ever leaving our own place, and this gives us a feeling of being complete. I myself feel whole when I finish creating each of my products. I believe that one should be satisfied with what one has done. \r\nFulfilling destiny … As a child, we were often taken on school excursions to the ceramics factory. I found everything there extremely interesting: from touching the clay to trying to tease something out of it. Thus I found my way to the potter’s wheel when I was 12 years old. I learned this craft from great masters. My first teachers were Usto-kulol (master-porter) Abduqadir and his son Usto Kimsanboy Abdukadirov, who taught me many of the secrets of the Rishtan school. I earned my first money as a potter when I was only 15. I still remember bringing my first salary to my mother and, according to local tradition, her touching those banknotes to her forehead in thanks.  By the time I graduated from school, I realized that I was going to dedicate my life to ceramic art. Along with all other potters during those times, I worked in the local ceramics factory, but kept practicing the old traditional handmade techniques alongside this work.  \r\nIt has been over 50 years since I started out in this noble profession. I have participated in many exhibitions and projects in numerous countries. People from all around the world are developing a keen interest in Rishtan ceramics. From time to time foreign colleagues and specialists have approached me with interesting  proposals and, in  the early years of Uzbekistan’s independence  in the 1990s, we started exchanging experiences with Japanese artisans. I am very proud to have been able to share my skills, while also learning a lot from the close friendships and collaboration we enjoyed with the masters of the Kutani-yaki porcelain school in Kamatsu.  You will notice some influences from these exchanges in my ceramics. \r\nIn 2005 I realised my dream of opening  the Rishtan Ceramics School.  Every year we admit dozens of children and train them in the traditions of Rishtan ceramics. In doing this I am able to pass my knowledge to future generations and feel that I am fulfilling my destiny. \r\n",

Participating in international and national exhibitions, Alisher Narzullaev became the winner of a number of professional competitions, was awarded the "Gold Medal" and the Prize of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan. His works are displayed in the collections of many museums and galleries around the world.\r\n \r\nExpressing love for my native land.  As a hereditary potter, I continued my father\'s trade. I have to admit that I did not immediately come to my own method, to the full blossoming of my creativity. This took many years and thousands of plates, jugs, vases and other objects thrown back into the clay until I developed my own aesthetic language, my vision of usta-kulol naqqosh (ceramic master-painter).\r\nThe Gijduvan School has retained its originality and is recognised as one of the main centers of glazed ceramics across Central Asia. As in other "pottery capitals" of Uzbekistan such as Rishtan, Khorezm and Tashkent, the traditionalist masters have many similar techniques - using local clay, mineral and plant components for dyes and glaze, and almost the same methods of burning in the kiln. But there are differences in shapes, colors and patterns employed by the various schools.  Unlike others, which mainly use white and blue colors, the predominance of yellow and green is traditional for Gijduvan. However, it is due to the graceful harmony of our floral ornaments and geometric patterns that has led to the popularity of our works far beyond the borders of Bukhara. \r\nAll my life I have tried to give each object an individuality, to convey a certain message through form and composition. Through my ceramics I am conveying a rather simple message, an expression of quiet love for my native land. Everyday work taught me a lot; most importantly to be patient, work hard, feel what’s really necessary and to eliminate the superfluous. Indeed, a simple shape and laconic pattern might convey a lot: deep feelings, great images and innermost dreams. It is for such inspiration that I  frequently travel in search of fresh impressions and to develop new ideas: to the Pamir mountains, Issyk-Kul lake, Khorezm and Samarkand.\r\n\r\nWhen objects sing.  In each of my pieces I try to impart a separate, delicate and intimate feeling.  This may be tender sadness, joyful exclamation, energetic gait, peace after rain, youthful romanticism or a desire to create. By painting landscapes on ceramics, I try to convey the joy of constant creative work, the beauty of a woman\'s face or the nature of my homeland.\r\nEvery artistic element must be thoroughly executed, with scrupulous attention to detail. All this, coupled with clay work, often results in  a very long process. However, time is required in order to convey an exact image that allows an item made for everyday use to sing. Every bend in a ceramic dish from a master can say a lot. Each symbol in the ornament can be read in its own way.  I am especially happy when my works travel all over the world and people not only see, but also hear in them the images of our native land.\r\n\r\nOpening doors for the next generation. In 1970, I successfully graduated from the Samarkand Institute of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and at first worked at construction sites as a foreman and engineer. I was preparing for an official career and there were many tempting offers to remain in this field of work but, I was always drawn to ceramics. I spent all my free time at the potter’s wheel and eventually took up this craft professionally.\r\nThe people of Gijduvan have long chosen their path, and our ceramics are not mass production, but art. During the time of the Bukhara Emirate, over forty workshops operated here, of which five belonged to my ancestors - the brothers Narzi and Tosh, the sons of Ergash Kulol and the grandchildren of the founder of the dynasty, Sharifiddin Gijduvani (1790-1885).\r\nI have participated in more than a hundred exhibitions at both national and international level, and have taken high places in competitions and festivals. I have been awarded with an international UNESCO certificate and state awards in Uzbekistan. I am grateful for such honours, but for all my life I never strived for these regalia. I just want to express my love for the people and the nature of my native land, and to convey this love to others.\r\nHundreds of foreign guests have visited our family workshop – from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary tourists, to whom we are always glad to show how we work. I have demonstrated my art and given master-classes in many countries in Europe, Asia and America. I have been lucky to work with many colleagues abroad, exchanging experiences and ideas with them. Among them is one of the most famous masters of ceramics in Japan, Asakura Isokichi. In 2002, I visited Germany and studied the experience of German masters there and shared with  them my own.\r\nI have three sons and a daughter who are already the seventh generation of ceramists of the Gijduvan school, and they are all good at the art of pottery. They and dozens of other students give me great hope for the continuation of our art and the maintenance of  the high status of the Gijduvan school. With the help of international grants I was able to open the Gijduvan Pottery Center, where we teach children and young people our craft. I would like to believe that by passing on to them the foundations and secrets of our work, we are educating the next generation of Uzbek ceramists, opening the doors of opportunity to them to careers in this beautiful but difficult profession.  \r\n',

                text: "Sharofiddin Yusupov:  Restoring the Lost Secrets of Rishtan Ceramics \r\nSharofiddin Yusupov is a patriarch of the Rishtan School of Ceramics and one of the most celebrated craftsmen in Uzbekistan. He was born in 1945 in the family of usto-kulol (pottery master) Isomiddin Yusupov, but after the early death of his father he worked as an apprentice for other ceramic masters in Rishtan and Gurumsay. Sharofiddin Yusupov achieved early success due to his efforts at reviving traditional methods and by 1970 his works were already being exhibited internationally. By creating new patterns and colour designs, which were quickly adopted by other masters, he breathed life back into the Rishtan School of Ceramics and lifted it to an even higher aesthetic level.  Because of his virtuoso mastery of the art of painting on ceramics, Yusupov is often referred to as the “Paganini from Rishtan”. He holds a number of honorary titles and has received many awards both during Soviet times and by the Government of Uzbekistan, as well as from UNESCO. His works can be found in museums in Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as in a number of state and private collections around the world.\r\n\r\nThe patterns are like my children… First and foremost, the foundation of any ceramic work is the local clay. To give colour to our work we add stone, copper and other metal fumes to the dyes using only locally sourced, natural raw materials just as they did many years ago. I can’t say that in my job I do anything extraordinary; after all I am simply continuing the traditions of Ishkor (the sky-blue glaze) of Rishtan, where hundreds of masters worked for centuries before me.  However, all of my works hold a particular meaning for me, mainly because of the patterns drawn on them. There are traditional symbols, such as a branch of flowering pomegranates, the sun, amulet knives, the plumage of fairy birds and other good-fortune motifs. At the same time, my ceramic items also have my own interpretation of the “bodomgul” (almond flower), the “anorgul” (pomegranate flower) and the “chorbarg” (quatrefoil) that I present mixed in colours other than the traditional blue, for example milky white, green or brown-lilac. Both the traditional and newer patterns are so precious to me that they have become like my own children. But, of course, they could also have a deep individual meaning for anyone else who sees or uses them. Some of the patterns I created are even used nowadays in the interior design and ornamentation of modern buildings.\r\nI often get inspired when I go to museums or look at the great pictures and artworks in books and magazines. In some sense, I haven’t created anything new. I’m just trying to preserve the ancient tradition of our ancestors, enriching them and presenting them to people. \r\nApprentice to the masters  My father had a pottery workshop in our house, where I grew up and I fell in love with this profession in early childhood. I’m proud to continue my father’s trade and to be the seventh generation of this Rishtan dynasty of craftsmen although it hasn’t always been easy. I lost my father when I was 15 years old but was given the opportunity to become an apprentice to famous masters of their time, from whom I learned the secrets of the profession, performing their services and receiving their blessings. My time in their workshops was a real golden age for me. I believe that the level I have achieved today is also the answer to their prayers. I was fortunate enough to be a disciple to the best masters of the older generation: Ibrohim Kamilov, Parpijon Sattorov, Hotamali Polvonov, Yigitali Mahmudov, Musa Ismoilov and Kholmat Yunosov. \r\nNatural dyes have long been used in pottery since ancient times. It has always been a very complex and time-consuming process. For this reason, during the 1920s and 1930s, when ready-made paints and raw materials were imported from Russia, people quickly abandoned traditional methods and they were  almost forgotten by my time. Of course, this resulted in lower quality products and caused damage to the reputation of Rishtan ceramics. It's one thing when one doesn't have great teachers to pass on the secrets of their art, but it's worse when people do not insist on preserving the ancient knowledge that makes the art what it is.  Unfortunately, so many things remain lost to us from this period. It was the saddest moment in the history of our craft. \r\nAfter returning from compulsory military service in the late 1960s, I returned to my workshop and started participating in various exhibitions, meeting and exchanging views with different people when I realised that the path I had chosen was not the correct one for me. I decided to restore our traditional methods of producing Rishtan ceramics. At that time, the old traditions were preserved by masters from Gurumsaray, located in the Pop district of the Namangan region. I became an apprentice to them, massaged their clay for them, walked up and down the hills with them, picked herbs, prepared authentic dyes and painted them in the ancient way. This experience greatly contributed to my efforts in restoring the secrets of the Rishtan ceramic school including its main feature – Ishkor glaze.\r\nI continued expanding my knowledge of traditional techniques even after I had received some recognition and had started participating in international exhibitions. My first trip abroad was in 1970 to Hungary. The recognition I received was a platform that allowed me to meet and exchange with other masters. In Khorezm, I met the great master Raimberdi Matchanov and received his blessings. Many other people across Uzbekistan shared their invaluable experience with me, helping to restore the reputation of the Rishtan school as a producer of fine, high quality ceramics.  \r\nCreating a legacy…  I’m happy that people appreciate my work and the research that has gone into it. I was nominated for the All-Union Lenin Komsomol Prize in 1979 for my efforts to extract alkali from plants. Later, in 1987, I was awarded the title of Honoured Artist of Uzbekistan. In 1997, with the establishment of the Academy of Arts in Uzbekistan, I was in the first cohort of full members of the Academy. In 2005, on the occasion of my 60th birthday, I was awarded with the State Order of Selfless Service and in 2015, I was awarded with the Gold Medal of the Academy of Arts at an exhibition dedicated to my 70th birthday. In 1985, the great director Malik Kayumov made a film about my work. \r\nThere are now about 500 masters in Rishtan district . Among them are those who intend to preserve the Rishtan tradition and bring it to our people in a more refined way. And I’m glad that most of them are young people. We hope that the Rishtan School of Ceramics will serve people for many years to come. There are a lot of students in our workshop too. Both of my sons have followed in my steps and become recognised masters in their own right. My eldest son’s works were recently exhibited in the United States. And my grandson now represents the 9th generation in our dynasty. I believe in the young masters and I hope they will be worthy successors of this noble profession.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that no one enters this world as a master ceramist. Each apprentice learns first by imitating another, by following someone else's direction.  They become a true master only when they can discover their own path through a process of hard work and self-development. I wish them all the best in finding this self realisation and achieving their goal.\r\n",

He is a strict follower of the traditional handmade production of silk and semi-silk fabrics. Toshtemirov’s small-scale workshop makes fabrics of the highest quality, which are sought after by the textile experts and fashion designers who are ready to pay a premium for his exquisite product. The master’s activity isn’t limited to Margilan; he has passed his unique knowledge of old weaving techniques to others and has helped to reestablish artisan abr-ikat workshops across Uzbekistan while also adopting methods of other regional schools into his style.",
