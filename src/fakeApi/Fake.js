When spinning is finished, all gathered threads come to pass for color before the weaving process. Traditional masters use natural ingredients for colors, like pomegranate peel, walnut, leaves, and pigments of natural stones. For weaving, masters look at white silk thread, and in his mind, he draws what kind of he wants to create on it. Weaving it a more romantic process. Arms of masters hold thread like he is playing on strings of a harp, and his legs change the timbre of sounds. As soon as all processes are finished the audience of the master can admire the full composition of his masterpieces.         ',

        info: `Abdullo Narzullaev (born in 1963) comes from a world famous dynasty of master ceramists from Gijduvan. He has managed not only to preserve ancient traditions and restore some forgotten secrets of craftsmanship, but also to expand the artistic facets of the Gijduvan school of ceramics. Abdullo Narzullaev has visited more than 100 countries, where he participated in international exhibitions and conferences. He also founded a ceramics museum in Gijduvan, where items from all regions of Uzbekistan and Central Asia are displayed.`,
        name: 'Abdullo Narzullaev - Traditional Master of Gijduvan ceramics',
        category: 'ceramics',
        desc_one: `Attention to detail. In some ceramics centres narrow specialisations are adopted, where one family is engaged only in the clay manufacture, for example, while another is tasked with preparing the dyes.  However, in Gijduvan a master must be able to perform the whole process themselves from start to finish. This results in a very long and difficult process, especially when every step is performed the old-fashioned way and compromises are not tolerated.  Therefore, in addition to knowledge and experience,  great patience is required in carrying out each of the 24 stages of ceramic production.
        My father, the great master Ibodullo Narzullaev, used to say that no detail can be overlooked when we are working with ceramics. Even one oversight can seriously affect the quality of the product, but this can only be discovered after the final firing. I often tell a parable about an apprentice who for 20 years could not become a master simply because he did not blow off the dust before putting the product in the kiln and his work came out black. Our work begins with the selection of clay, which we source here in Gijduvan. We first remove the top seventy-centimetre layer and use only the next layer below. The clay must be clean, containing very little or no impurities such as sand.  We begin by experimenting on the selected clay, trying it first on small forms, and if it fits, only then will we work with it further. We add reed fluff to the clay, which reinforces it, making it stronger before finally we add gilmoya (bentonite), which is yellow sea clay from the Kiziltepa deposit ten kilometers from Gijduvan. The proportions of these ingredients are different depending on what kind of product is being made.`,
        image1: Abna1,
        theme_one: `Before serving on the potter's wheel, the clay is processed several times; first by feet, then by hand.`,
        desc_two: ` Next the clay is fed to the potter's wheel and moulding begins, after which it is necessary to dry the primary product a little and give it better shape. The following day, the excess layer is cut from the bottom. The item should now be dried at least a further two days before processing small flaws, grinding, and drying the product again.  At this stage it is again covered with a mix of liquid clay and natural dyes which we call engobe (slipware) to create a white, red or yellow background for the piece.  Again the item goes for further drying in the shade. Only after this can the painting begin.`,
        image2: Abna2,
        desc_three: `Restoring the past...  It is important for me to feel in my works the correlation of three things: ornament, colour and form. Gijduvan ceramic painting is represented only by floral and geometric ornament, since historically our religion has not approved of the image of living beings. As for the palette of colours, my works are more varied: blue - white - green, yellow – brown and other combinations. At the same time as keeping the tradition of floral-geometric ornament, I also try to incorporate elements or at least a hint of people's lives. For example, pomegranates and almonds are presented on jugs or dishes. When decorating a composition, I like to incorporate special techniques such as dots or spots painting and we also include many meaningful symbols in the form of fruits, flowers and feathers. As with other masters, I like to combine brush painting alongside engraving and carving.`,
        theme_two: '',
        desc_four: `After applying the ornament, each piece goes through two firings in the kiln, between which it is covered with glaze. After a ten year quest of searching and testing, we managed to restore the ancient technology of making Ishkor glaze using certain plant species, specifically the shrubs Qirqbugin (Equisétum arvénse), Tuyatovon (Zygophyllum oxianum), Balik Kuzi (“Fish eye”) and others growing in the vicinity of Bukhara and the Khorezm region. We harvest them in October, burning and mixing the ash with a small amount of quartz sand which is baked at a temperature of 1400 degrees Celcius to get the crystal from which the glaze is made. It is thanks to such glaze that ancient ceramics did not lose their properties for many centuries.
        Reflections from the master ... I am a sixth generation ceramist and since childhood have never considered another profession. It is customary here that children continue the work of their parents and grandparents. From the age of 6, my father took me with him to the workshop, and at the age of 14 I began to create my own items. 
        I am a teacher by profession, a graduate of the Pedagogical Institute from the Faculty of Engineering and Education. As a new graduate I taught at school and in my free time I made ceramics. After Uzbekistan achieved Independence, artists received an excellent opportunity to follow our beloved craft, and since 1992 I have completely devoted myself to ceramic art. Initially there were many who doubted and attempted to dissuade me, but my family supported me in my decision.  After a few years my work began to give good results. Of course, there have always been and will always remain difficulties, but it seems to me that there are no downsides to doing your favourite job, as with remaining devoted to a person who you truly love.
        Almost 30 years after my decision to dedicate my life to ceramic art, in addition to crafting ceramic, I now actively participate at international exhibitions and exchange programs among craftsmen from different countries; I have already visited 108 countries, some more than once.
        Yet I am especially proud of the ceramics museum we founded in 2000 in Gijduvan, where items from all regions of Uzbekistan and Central Asia are on display. It was also a kind of challenge, and without the support of collectors and craftsmen from all over our country, we certainly would not have been able to gather such a large exposition as we do now.
        
        I have two daughters and a son, who also continue our work. My son works with me and my daughters are engaged in ceramics and Suzani embroidery. All have received university education and are following in our footsteps, continuing the work of our ancestors. 
        It is a fact that not everyone can stand such work. Many come to study with the intention to become masters, but are gone after a week. However, many persevere and I am happy to say that a number of wonderful artists have emerged from my workshop, some of whom have gained international fame. As our patron saint Hazrati Amir Kulol once said, “the master sees his reflection not in the mirror, but in his disciples”.`
